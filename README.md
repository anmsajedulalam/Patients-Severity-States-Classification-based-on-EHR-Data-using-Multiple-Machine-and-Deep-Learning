## First attempt abstract:

This paper presents an analysis that is aimed at predicting the severity of patients according to their electronic
health records in a specific time span by implementing supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. The proposed approach analyses the severity score prediction using an EHR dataset obtained from
an open-source platform. The data pre-processing was done using tools such as openRefine. To implement
the approach, different supervised learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, KNN,
CatBoost, and unsupervised learning algorithms such as K-means clustering, Spectral Clustering, Gaussian
Mixture Model, Hierarchical Clustering and Principal Component Analysis are being used. The experimental
results demonstrate that supervised learning outperforms unsupervised learning on the dataset for the expected
outcomes.

## First attempt conclusion:

In this paper, a performance analysis of predicting the patient severity scores has been proposed and successfully implemented by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques upon an EHR dataset. This analysis is planned and executed with consideration of blood test report data such as the patient’s amount of Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, Erythrocyte, Thrombocytes and all the other measurements of different cells in blood. Our proposed approach can assess and forecast the severity of patients in cases when there is a shortage of medical beds in pandemics and we can’t provide all of the patients beds in the hospital, so we have to make quick decisions about who needs a medical bed and who doesn’t. In this instance, instead of human brain decisions, this strategy can make things faster as an automated procedure. Patients with less severe conditions can simply be alerted about their health status and taken home; on the other hand, when patients are at high risk, their families can take required steps to improve the paient’s position. As a result of our research, we discovered that supervised classification algorithms outperformed unsupervised algorithms in predicting patient severity score.

## Second attempt abstract:

This research presents an examination of categorizing the severity
states of patients based on their electronic health records during a certain time
range using multiple machine learning and deep learning approaches. The
suggested method uses an EHR dataset collected from an open-source platform
to categorize severity. Some tools were used in this research, such as
openRefine was used to pre-process, RapidMiner was used for implementing
three algorithms (Fast Large Margin, Generalized Linear Model, Multi-layer
Feed-forward Neural Network) and Tableau was used to visualize the data, for
implementation of algorithms we used Google Colab. Here we implemented
several supervised and unsupervised algorithms along with semi-supervised and
deep learning algorithms. The experimental results reveal that
hyperparameter-tuned Random Forest outperformed all the other supervised
machine learning algorithms with 76% accuracy as well as Generalized Linear
algorithm achieved the highest precision score 78%, whereas the
hyperparameter-tuned Hierarchical Clustering with 86% precision score and
Gaussian Mixture Model with 61% accuracy outperformed other unsupervised
approaches. Dimensionality Reduction improved results a lot for most
unsupervised techniques. For implementing Deep Learning we employed a
feed-forward neural network (multi-layer) and the Fast Large Margin approach
for semi-supervised learning. The Fast Large Margin performed really well with
a recall score of 84% and an F1 score of 78%. Finally, the Multi-layer
Feed-forward Neural Network performed admirably with 75% accuracy, 75%
precision, 87% recall, 81% F1 score.

## Second attempt conclusion:

This research proposes and effectively implements a performance analysis of
categorizing the illness severity from their electronic health record data using
supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised machine learning as well as deep learning
techniques. This study is planned and carried out with the help of clinical report data
such as the patient's Hematocrit, Hemoglobin, Erythrocyte, Thrombocytes, and all
other measurements of different cells in the blood. Our proposed approach can
analyze and forecast the severity of patients’ illness in situations when there is a
scarcity of medical services because of the large number of patients and medical staff
cannot give all of the patient's services in the hospital because of limited spaces,
therefore we must make quick decisions about who requires emergency care and who
does not. In this case, rather than relying on the human brain decisions of medical
staff, this method can expedite things as an automated procedure. Patients with less
severity of the illness can simply be informed of their condition and taken home; on
the other hand, when patients are at high risk, they will get higher priority to get
medical service first. From this research, we found multiple supervised, unsupervised,
semi-supervised machine learning and deep learning algorithms are useful for
categorizing patients’ illness severity states as a result of our research. In a short
summary from result analysis, from unsupervised clustering techniques,
hyperparameter-tuned Hierarchical with 86% precision score and Gaussian Mixture
Model with 61% accuracy worked really well. Noticeably, dimension reduction
helped a lot to improve results, especially in the case of unsupervised methods.
Furthermore, from supervised learning techniques, hyperparameter-tuned Random
Forest outperformed all other supervised techniques at the accuracy of 0.76, also
according to precision score Generalized Linear algorithm performed the best with
78% score. The Semi-supervised approach Fast Large Margin performed
unexpectedly well with 84% recall score and 78% F1 score. Lastly, the Deep learning
approach Multi-layer Feed-forward Neural Network performed outstandingly with
75% accuracy, 75% precision, 87% recall, 81% F1 score. As our goal of this research
was to improve the previous work [6] and try out different new models, we were able
to do both and from our observations, we found out in previous work
hypermeter-tuned XGBoost was performing best, but in our experiments, Random
Forest performed best among supervised classifiers with 76% accuracy. Also, in
previous work [6], they only used supervised classification, but we tried out,
supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised machine learning models along with deep
learning techniques, and from these new model experiments we got new insights
which we have explained in detail already
